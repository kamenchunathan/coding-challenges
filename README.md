# Coding Challenges

A repo of coding challenges inspired by Daniel Shiffman's series on youtube. The challenges are an interesting way to learn new and fun algorithms

The projects are written in rust using [nannou](nannou.cc) the creative coding library for rendering

The coding challenges are not organized or attempted in any particular order. I do them in the order I like.

In addition some projects not part of the original coding challenges series will also be included.
Where the project is  directly inspired by the series the corresponding coding challenge number as well as link to the youtube video and website page will be included.


## Project Organization
This project is organized into cargo workspaces


## Building and running
Written in rust therefore you must have rust and cargo installed

To run any specific project run `cargo run -p <coding_challenge_name>` from the root of the project

For projecs with additional building instructions read the `README.md` in the project directory
